Data Analysis
The analysis is performed using Jupyter notebooks located in the notebooks/ directory. The key aspects explored include:

Cuisine Analysis: Identifying popular food choices among customers.
Rating Distribution: Understanding customer satisfaction based on restaurant ratings.
Delivery Time Analysis: Evaluating the efficiency of the delivery service and its impact on ratings.
Usage:

Start Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open and run the notebooks located in the notebooks/ directory.
Results
The analysis revealed insights such as:

Popular cuisines on Swiggy.
Distribution of ratings and identification of outliers.
Correlation between delivery time and customer ratings.
Conclusion
This project highlights the power of data analysis in optimizing food delivery services. By understanding customer preferences and service dynamics, platforms like Swiggy can enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Future Work
